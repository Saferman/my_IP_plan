The reason western media has been drawn into a guessing game is that the infighting of the CPC is playing out behind a thick curtain. A lot of media professionals and China experts are quite anxious. It’s not that we don’t have any information at all. We surely can see shadows moving behind the curtain. But we don’t know who the shadows are, not to mention what shadow A said to shadow B.

In this circumstance, the Chinese-style political rumors are quite useful, and some international media have had to swallow their pride and join this guessing game. Whereas in China, anonymous bloggers have been leaking information that “guides public opinion.” For example, Gu Kailai’s involvement in the death of Heywood was first leaked in a microblog (weibo) and caught the attention of international media. After much digging by the media, Gu Kailai is now part of the Bo scandal.
